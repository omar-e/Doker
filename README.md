" In above folders I've made two flask app, one uses mySQL database and one redis database. The one that uses mySQL datbase is just a simple application and puts its data in the database for storage purposes. The one that uses the redis is more complicated.This is because redis is a multi-purpose database. We have used it to count how many visits it gets.
